## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Go by Example!

* If you see a typo or would like to suggest another small change, editing the
  .go or .sh source file should be sufficient for the PR. I can rebuild the
  HTML when I review the change.

* We're open to adding more examples to the site. They should be on things
  used by many programmers and only require the standard library. If you're
  interested in adding an example, _please open an issue to discuss the topic
  first_.

* We're not going to change the navigation of the site, in particular adding
  a "previous section" link or an "index" link other than the on the title
  text.
